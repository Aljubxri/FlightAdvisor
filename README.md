# FlightAdvisor 
By - Mohammed Aljubori

I made this project because I wanted to make a useful project that also implemented API's and webscraping. It was really fun working on this and I will be adding more usescases. (check out the ideas.txt file!)

# Instructions to run
Must have beautifulsoup4 (bs4) and requests installed. 
At the moment the input will 100% work for any flights or cities in the US, however international funcionality is being worked on. 

# How to start it
The objects are already initiated in main.py, however it will require a valid US flight number as well (if that option is chosen)
The following prompts will be given:
**City only**
```


```
**Flight**
```
```
