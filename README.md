# FlightAdvisor 
By - Mohammed Aljubori

I made this project because I wanted to make a useful project that also implemented API's and web scraping. <br> It was really fun working on this, and I will be adding more use cases. (Check out the ideas.txt file!)

## Requirements
Must have:
* API key from openweathermap (free to sign up)<br>
* installed beautifulsoup4 (bs4)
* installed requests. <br>

## How to run
** At the moment the input will 100% work for any flights or cities in the US, however international functionality is being worked on. **<br>
The objects are already initiated in main.py, however it will require a valid US flight number as well (if that option is chosen)

<br>

## Example outputs
### Flight 

*  	***Here flight AAL642 is used as example***
